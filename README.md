Web Scraper on PagineGialle.it

Class: Scrapler.py

Parsed with BeautifulSoup4

Used sqlite3 for the DB

Make sure you have BeautifulSoup4 in your python directory

Used mainly the official BeautifulSoup4 guide here: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#kinds-of-objects
but also some tutorial on youtube and some advices on StackOverflow.
