Web Scrapler on PagineGialle.it

Class: Scrapler.py



v0.1
  from one page PagineGialle the code prints the name of the society with the relative address
  TODO:
    -implement a stack for the webpages already scrapled
    -add telephone number and website
    -add all information into a MySQLdb
  


Used mainly the official BeautifulSoup4 guide here: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#kinds-of-objects
but also some tutorial on youtube and some advices on StackOverflow.
